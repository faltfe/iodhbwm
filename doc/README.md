This project provides the _unofficial_ template of the [DHBW Mannheim](http://www.dhbw-mannheim.de) for
the creation of bachelor thesis, studies or project work with _LaTeX_. The goal of the package is
the quick creation of a basic framework without much effort.

The documentation is currently only available in German.
